            Front end design is what carries along every modern business today.  I have built a 5 star reputation from being a very dedicated massage therapist, and giving each client the attention they deserve.  All of that however falls short of being competitive in today's world unless someone can find you on the internet.  This is part of my drive to learn programming and make my business of seven years run better and easier.  I am married to my wife, Wendy, and we will celebrate 15 years together in December.  We have four amazing children, Samson, Sophia, Calvin, and Cliona. They are also much of my drive to keep learning and evolve from simply a massage thereapist, but a creator of a truly competitive business.I am having a lot of fun learning what we can create with the little tools we have been taught, and floored at how much I still want to learn.</p>
